### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and Kubernetes enthusiast who loves sharing my knowledge of cloud native technologies. I have over 5 years of experience running production workloads on Kubernetes.

In my day job, I work on architecting and operating a large multi-cluster K8s environment for a fast-growing startup. This involves things like scalability, security, cost optimization and more. Outside of work, I love hiking, sci-fi movies, and playing video games when I can find the time! If you found this Kubernetes ingress tutorial helpful, check out some of my other writing on topics like monitoring, autoscaling and security. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any feedback or tutorial requests! ðŸ‘‹
