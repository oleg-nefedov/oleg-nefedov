### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and Kubernetes enthusiast who loves sharing my knowledge of cloud native technologies. I have over 5 years of experience running production workloads on Kubernetes.

In my day job, I work on architecting and operating a large multi-cluster K8s environment for a fast-growing startup. This involves things like scalability, security, cost optimization and more. We heavily leverage ingress controllers like NGINX for all our public facing services and APIs.

In my free time, I enjoy writing technical tutorials that provide useful real-world examples of Kubernetes concepts. I aim to explain things in a simple, easy to understand way - bringing my experience operating large scale deployments.

My goal is to help engineers new to Kubernetes avoid common pitfalls and develop a solid foundational understanding. I believe hands-on practice and concrete examples are key for mastering these technologies.

Outside of work, I love hiking, sci-fi movies, and playing video games when I can find the time! If you found this Kubernetes ingress tutorial helpful, check out some of my other writing on topics like monitoring, autoscaling and security. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any feedback or tutorial requests! ðŸ‘‹
